Some platforms require additional dependencies as listed below. If your platform have no pre-compiled binary, you need to build from source.

### Windows

The executable requires support for Visual C++. You can refer to the [Visual C++ support documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-160) for installation instructions.

### Linux

`libxcb` and `libgtk-3` are required to run the application on Linux, and most desktop environments come with these packages pre-installed.

### NetBSD

On NetBSD a pre-compiled binary is available from the official repositories, to install it simply run:

```bash
pkgin install four-bar-rs
```

## Build from Source

In Linux, you need to install some library for GUI.

This is an example for `apt`, please see <https://github.com/emilk/egui#demo>.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

Then run with cargo directly:

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo run --release -- --help
```

### WebAssembly

Powered by `trunk` (<https://github.com/thedodd/trunk>), a Rust CLI tool for creating bin-type WASM projects.

Run those scripts from the repository:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install trunk
cd four-bar-ui
# Serve in localhost
trunk serve
# Compile WASM
trunk build --release
```

The application package will be deployed in the `dist` directory.
